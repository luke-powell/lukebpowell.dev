					As of now, I have one big box on my resume for work experience: <b class="text-secondary">PrecisePK</b>.
					It's a start-up stationed in San Diego that develops technologies for assisting doctors and pharmacists
					in dosing drugs to patients. Doctors are able to enter patient information, then get suggestions
					for dose amounts depending on what the doctor wants to target. Then, as the doctor enters measured serum
					level concentrations of the drug after the initial administration, the reccommendations will get more
					and more precise and tailor-fit to the patient. This is all due to our machine learning algorithm!
				</p>
				<p>
					Personally, I've dipped my hand in pretty much every part of the program. To name a few:
					<ul>
						<li>Worked heavily in C++, co-developing a library for simulating the pharmacokinetics (PK) 
							of patients -- the real "brain" behind the app. This could have a list of bullet points in itself.</li>
						<li>Helped build the server infrastructure. It was developed using the Express framework and runs
							on several AWS EC2 instances, requests split using load balancers.
						</li>
						<li>Designed server infrastructure and helped develop the React-based front-end for an in-house tool 
							for issuing new accounts for the web app, 
							as well as legacy support for issuing keys for the older desktop app.
						</li>
						<li>Wrote large portions of MySQL queries, called from JavaScript, for saving/loading data for the app
							and storing license information.
						</li>
					</ul>
