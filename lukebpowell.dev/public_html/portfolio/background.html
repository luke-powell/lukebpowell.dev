				<p>
					Hello, and welcome to my <b class="text-secondary">Portfolio</b>!
				</p>

				<p>
					My name is Luke Powell, and I am currently finishing up my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
					at the University of California, San Diego. 
				</p>

				<p>
					My time as an undergrad has taught me so much about so many different areas of programming,
					design, and web technologies. I've always had a fondness for both mathematics and technology,
					so I feel right at home in a field that is where these two areas meet. I hope to pursue a
					career in things that really interest me -- applications of computer science in environmental
					science, internet of things technology, AI, and if I feel like pursuing a life-long
					hobby of mine, video game development.
				</p>

				<p>
				</p>
				
				<aside>
					For hobbies, I enjoy both indoor and outdoor activites; When I'm inside, for example while 
					quarantining during a global pandemic, I enjoy indoor activities like reading, playing video games, 
					binging shows on Netflix, and - if I'm feeling creative - producing music or working on indie game projects. I
					also like to go outside and enjoy nature, whether that be going on jogs around my neighborhood
					in University City, sitting on the beach, or camping in the mountains with my family.
