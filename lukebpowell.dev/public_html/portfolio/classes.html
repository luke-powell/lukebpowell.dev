				<h2>CSE 134B - Web Client Languages</h2>
				<p>This class taught me a lot about web client technologies. My first real experience
					in front-end development was an application entirely built in React.js. Therefore
					I feel like I missed out a lot on the fundamentals of HTML and JS that was really
					holding me back. This class forced me to re-learn everything from the ground up,
					and I'm very grateful to have taken a class this relevant to my current field of
					work.

				<ul>
					<li><p>For this class, the main project was a Portfolio -- this very one! It started
						out as just a class project, but I have a feeling that it will be used long after
						I get my grade.

				<h2>CSE 110 - Software Engineering</h2>
				<p>This class was one of duality: lectures going over design patterns, development approaches,
					and general information of the field of software development; and a software development project,
					done out of class in teams of 10. It was my first experience working on something so big with a
					large group. We had meetings going over the design of the project, what we should include, and
					how it would be implemented. By the end of the 10 weeks we had a fully functional roommate
					management app built for Android.

				<h2>CSE 167A - Computer Graphics</h2>
				<p>Being a lifelong fan of video games, and an aspiring indie game dev myself, I just had to
					take this class. It was incredibly fun -- we worked in C++ using OpenGL to create a rendering
					engine completely from scratch. Each lab built on the previous, until the final project, where
					we formed groups and created our own video game demos. Ours was a walking simulator set
					in a cel-shaded, procedurally generated tropical environment. My favorite part of this was
					creating the algorithms for generating the terrain and seeing completely random, but beautiful
					terrain come out of it. I would definitely pursue a career in this kind of work.
